# TRacking and Analysis of CEll Cycle (TRACE) 

TRACE is an interactive web tool for tracking and segmenting cells from live-cell microscopy images. It was implemented using the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) platform and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework on the server backend. It uses iRODS (https://irods.org/) for data storage and management and uses OpenCV (https://opencv.org/) for video frame extraction and management. 

## Install
This section is aimed for developers interested in working on the code. It provides guidance for setting up docker-based Django server local development environment for TRACE.

### Prerequisite
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/ "Docker") and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/ "Docker Compose") need to be installed. On Windows 10 and above, native Docker may be installed and used. Otherwise, a Linux VM is needed.

### Steps to run TRACE Django web server in your local development environment
- git clone source code from this repo.
- Modify server/config/ct-config.yaml file to change ```CC_PATH``` to point to the root directory of the source tree for TRACE, and change ```HOST_USER_UID``` and ```HOST_USER_GID``` to correspond to the uid and gid of the user on the host who is running docker containers for TRACE.
- Copy local_settings.py from cellcycledev.renci.org and put it under the celltracker directory. This local_settings.py holds sensitive information, so should not be exposed to the outside world.
- From the root directory of the source tree, run ```./ctctl deploy_dev_nodb``` to build all containers.
- At this point you should be able to open up your browser to get to the TRACE page: http://localhost:8000, or http://192.168.56.101:8000/ from the host if host-only adaptor is set up in VirtualBox for the Linux VM running on a windows box.


### Useful docker-compose commands to manage docker containers 
- ```docker-compose up``` --- bring up all containers
- ```docker-compose stop``` --- shut down all containers
- ```docker-compose ps``` --- check status of all containers
- ```docker rm -fv $(docker ps -a -q)``` --- remove all containers
- ```docker rmi -f <image_id>``` where ```<image_id>``` is the image id output from ```docker images``` command which you want to remove. 

### Troubleshooting notes
- You may need to run ```docker-compose stop``` followed by ```docker-compose up``` when you run into issues when bringing up containers the first time. 
- To run ```./ctctl``` command again, you need to clean up existing containers and images by running ```docker rm -fv $(docker ps -a -q)``` to remove all containers and ```docker rmi -f <image_id>``` to remove images that need to be rebuilt.
