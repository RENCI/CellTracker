This directory is used for the web server to write logs in a development environment by default as set up in docker-compose-dev.yml file. Sometimes if this directory does not exist already, the root in the docker container will create this log directory as part of the log directory volume mount between the host and the docker container. When this happens, the web server cannot write logs due to permission denied error and will exit as a result. To prevent this from happening, creating this directory as part of initial git clone as normal user so as not to run into permission issues when the server tries to write logs.
